# Physics Capstone - Research Activities

_These are class materials that are part of the Physics Capstone course, and specifically related to undergraduate physics research. The materials have been changed for general use outside of one particular university. The slides of classes can be accessed by clicking on the class numbers._

**[Research Introduction](Slides/ClassResearch1Intro.pptx)**
* Group discussion about the definition of research and the motivation for people to do physics research.
* Group discussion about the differences between in-class and research-based learning; based on presentations about this topic by Prof. Raluca Teodorescu (Montgomery College).
* Discussion about best practices for working with a research advisor.
* Group discussion about research methodology, followed by discussions about the research methodology of an undergraduate research project and specifics about the research literature study.

**[Research Ethics](Slides/ClassResearch2Ethics.pptx)**
* Team presentations on research ethics, based on reading of [_On Being a Scientist: A Guide to Responsible Conduct in Research_](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/12192/on-being-a-scientist-a-guide-to-responsible-conduct-in), and using a [grading sheet](../Materials/EthicsPresentationsGrading.docx).

**[Research Project](Slides/ClassResearch3Project.pptx)**
* Abstract for undergraduate research project, graded with a [rubric](../Materials/ResearchProjectAbstractRubric.docx).
* Short (4-5 minute) presentations about undergraduate research projects, graded with a [rubric](../Materials/ResearchProjectPresentationRubric.docx).

**Guest Presentations**
* Short (5-10 minute) presentations by faculty in the first couple of weeks of the semester, to give an overview of the research performed in the department.
