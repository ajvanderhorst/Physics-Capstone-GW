_These class materials and grading rubrics have been changed for general use outside of one particular university. All the group discussions are typically for groups of 3 students._

**[Class 1](Slides/Class01.pptx)**
* Group discussion about what students think a Capstone Experience is, followed by an explanation of the structure of the Capstone Experience at the particular university.
* Explanation and discussion of the learning objectives and deliverables of the Physics Capstone course and Physics Symposium course, and the structure of the Physics Capstone course.
* Introduction to Phys21, the report from the Joint Task force on Undergraduate Physics Programs, about preparing physics students for 21st-century careers.
* Group discussion about what skills physicists have and/or need, in four categories: physics-specific knowledge, scientific & technical skills, communication skills, professional & workspace skills.
* Discussion of some important statistics regarding physics employment and other outcomes from the Phys21 report.
* Individual activity: students make a list of skills they have, evidence showing that they have those skills, and skills they expect to have when they graduate.

**[Class 2](Slides/Class02.pptx)**
* Two short (5-10 minute) presentations by faculty about their research, to give students an overview of the research being performed in the department.
* Group discussion about what students think the definition of research is, and what the motivation is for people to do physics research.
* Group discussion about the differences between in-class and research-based learning.
* Discussion about best practices for working with a research advisor.
* Group discussion about research methodology, followed by discussions about the research methodology of an undergraduate research project and some specifics about a research literature study.
* Homework assignment about research ethics, based on [_On Being a Scientist: A Guide to Responsible Conduct in Research_](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/12192/on-being-a-scientist-a-guide-to-responsible-conduct-in) by the Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy; National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and Institute of Medicine of the National Academies.
