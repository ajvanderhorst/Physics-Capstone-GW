* Discussion about best practices for working with a research advisor.
* Group discussion about research methodology, followed by discussions about the research methodology of an undergraduate research project and specifics about the research literature study.

**[Class 3](Slides/Class03.pptx)**
* Two short (5-10 minute) presentations by faculty about their research.
* Team presentations about research ethics, based on [_On Being a Scientist: A Guide to Responsible Conduct in Research_](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/12192/on-being-a-scientist-a-guide-to-responsible-conduct-in), using a [grading sheet](Materials/EthicsPresentationsGrading.docx).

**[Class 4](Slides/Class04.pptx)**
* Two short (5-10 minute) presentations by faculty about their research.
* Discussion about the learning objectives of Writing in the Disciplines, focused on different audiences and genres.
* Discussion about learning new genres using the CAT (Collect, Analyze, Try) approach, and tips for analyzing new genres; based on the Writing Transfer Project (C. Hayes, George Washington University; G. Gorzelsky, Colorado State University; J. Paszek, University of Detroit Mercy).
* Homework assignment: write an abstract for [Physics Today](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/journal/pto), appropriate for the audience of the journal.

**[Class 5](Slides/Class05.pptx)**
* Two short (5-10 minute) presentations by faculty about their research.
* One-to-one peer review of the Physics Today abstracts.

* Feedback on one-to-one peer review of previous class.
* Introduction to LaTeX, with an in-class demo in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com).
* Discussion of presentations: preparation, purpose, slides, and style; based on presentations about this topic by Prof. Ralph A.M.J. Wijers (University of Amsterdam).
* Homework assignment: revised version of Physics Today abstract based on peer review and instructor feedback, and short (2 minute) presentation about the same Physics Today article.

**[Class 7](Slides/Class07.pptx)**
* Short (2 minute) presentations about a Physics Today article, with a focus on presentation style; individual feedback after every presentation provided in class by the instructor.
* Homework assignment: preparation for elevator pitch.

**Class 8**
* Guest lecture about physics careers and skills of physicists, including materials from the [Careers Toolbox](https://www.spsnational.org/sites/all/careerstoolbox/) of the Society of Physics Students.

**[Class 9](Slides/Class09.pptx)**
* Final short presentations about a Physics Today article, with a focus on presentation style.
* Elevator pitches in groups of 3-4 students, with clear roles of group members and peer feedback.

**Class 10**
* Guest lecture by an industry career coach for STEM students at the university's Career Services office, focused on what skills to highlight in applications, how to conduct a job search, and how to prepare for interviews, with various online resources (at the university, nationally, and internationally)

**Class 11**
* Guest lecture by an industry career coach for STEM students at the university's Career Services office, focused on the most relevant facilities, resources and services offered to students.

**[Class 12](Slides/Class12.pptx)**
* Group discussions about interactions of physicists with society.
