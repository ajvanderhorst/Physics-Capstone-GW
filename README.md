Course Materials for Physics Capstone at The George Washington University

This course has been revamped in the Fall 2018 semester, as part of a new Physics Capstone experience at the George Washington University. Students work in a mentored learning environment to design and conduct research in physics in an ethical manner, explore and prepare for various careers in physics, and disseminate research findings to different audiences. All Physics majors (including the BS in Physics, Biophysics and Astrophysics, and the BA in Physics) take the Physics Capstone course (PHYS 4195; 3 credits) in the Fall of their junior year. During the Spring of their junior year and Fall of their senior year, the BS students do most of their undergraduate research project under the supervision of a faculty member (3 credits). In the Spring of their senior year, the BS students will take the Physics Symposium course (PHYS 4200; 1 credit), which guides them in preparing a report, a poster and a presentation on their research project. Students can earn credit in the Physics Capstone course for two elements of their General Education Curriculum: Writing and Oral Communication.

This repository contains materials of the Physics Capstone course (PHYS 4195), including the syllabus, slides, and grading rubrics. In the Fall 2018 semester, there were 21 students in the course. The primary instructor invited various guest instructors for specific aspects of the course.
